# Database Schema (DDL)

This folder contains the SQL schema defining the structure of the Airbnb-like database.

### Files
- `schema.sql` — Contains all CREATE TABLE and INDEX statements.

### Overview
The schema defines four main tables:
- **User** — Stores user details.
- **Property** — Stores property listings.
- **Booking** — Links users to properties.
- **Payment** — Records payment details for bookings.

All relationships and constraints follow the design from the ER diagram and normalization steps.
