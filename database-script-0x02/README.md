# Database Seed Script (DML)

This folder contains the SQL script used to populate the Airbnb-like database with sample data.

### Files
- `seed.sql` â€” Inserts sample records into all main tables (User, Property, Booking, Payment).

### Overview
The sample data simulates realistic interactions:
- Multiple users with unique properties.
- Bookings linking users and properties.
- Payments reflecting completed and pending transactions.

The seed data allows testing of joins, queries, and relationships in a near real-world context.
